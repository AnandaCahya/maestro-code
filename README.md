# Maestro Code

I think you find this for your task or something else related with this project? I made this code editor to fill my spare time and learn electron. And yes... Let's just say that I want to create a lightweight code editing ecosystem that suits me. I don't know if it will be lightweight or not. But I hope so

## To Do

- [ ] Code Tab
- [ ] File or Folder read
- [X] Code editor highlight
- [ ] Discord Rich Presence (I test it but not prepared)
- [ ] File icon
- [X] Code right click
- [X] Code find (Click CTRL+F)
- [ ] Make code editor look better or something else
- [ ] Add package manager (npm, pip or anything else)
- [ ] Environment variable manager
- [ ] Video file preview, Photo preview or anything media preview
- [ ] Version Control System
- [ ] Lint For all language (You can see like unused variable or anything like that)

## It's Open Source?

Yes, I Like someone to use and explore with me like this so you can help me to make this software more better. I Have skill issues so i'am sorry if you see bugs or problem related this project.
